The assistant can understand the elements on your screen when needed, helping you identify and interact with almost everything displayed. It can then provide convenient assistance. **This will be an unprecedented convenience!!!** Here are some ideas for you to consider.

## Your Travel Assistant {#trip-assistant}

When you see a friendâ€™s post on social media showing a beautiful place they visited, and you feel inspired to go there too, what would you do next?

- **Traditional Approach:**
  
  1. Directly ask your friend where the place is, (wait for a reply...) then search for a guide and plan your trip.
  2. Save the picture, use image search on various platforms to find information, then search for a guide and plan your trip.

- **Now:**
  
  1. Simply open the photo on social media and tell the assistant, "I want to go here."

You can also improve your experience by asking further questions like, "Give me some travel suggestions."

The assistant will then automatically guide you from your current location to your desired destination, summarizing travel options for you. The final result might look like this:

You can also choose to have the assistant first introduce the attractions, then plan the route, and finally give you some travel suggestions:
